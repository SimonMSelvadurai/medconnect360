## <a name="about-this-project"></a> About this project
This app shows all the ist of registered doctors from various clinic. 
As a user we can able to search for the users. 
User may able to create login and book the appoinments with the doctors.
User may able to see the list of created appointments.
User may able to edit, cancel the appointments.

### <a name="how-the-app-is-built"></a> How the app is built
On the front end side, this project is built using React, which is an open-source Javascript library developed at Facebook specifically for the task of developing user interfaces. React relies on a component-based architecture where elements of the user interface are broken into small chunks of code called components. Material UI is a css framework that helps with building these components. Material UI is a React component library that implements Googleâ€™s material design.

On the back end side, this project uses MongoDB, Node, Express, Mongoose ORM (Object Relational Mapper), JWT, and various third party packages. Node, MongoDB, and Mongoose are used to query and route data in the app. Express is the backend web framework used for this app. JWT is authentication middleware for Node.js (that is, the technology used to log users into the app). 

### <a name="workflow"></a> App workflow

#### Home 
Home/Landing page will be help the users to get all the registered active doctors/specialists.

#### Authentication
When you first visit the app, you will be prompted to log in (if you have already created an account) or sign up (if you are a new user). To sign up, you will need to provide an email address as well as create a username and password. Authentication is required because it ensures that a user's health information is protected and blocked from other users.

#### Home 
After user has been authenticated, user may able to see the user related options on the Home/Landing page. 
From this page, you can navigate to all the different pages with the app .

#### Book Online
This button will take you to the Page where user able to book an appointment.When the user clicks the "Book Appointment" button
user can able to provide personal details and booking date and choose the doctors from the list.
Once the booking is done, user able to see the list of booking booked as a list.
User has the opertunity to modify the details by pressing the Edit button.
User may able to cancel the booking by pressing the cancel button.

#### My Appointments

The Appointments page lists your upcoming appoinments and related information in table format. You can add and remove appointments from this page.


#### Our Team 
The Doctors and clinics page has contact information for each of your doctors, such as doctor name, email address, and office location. You can also add contact information for each clinic. After you add your doctors and clinics, you can associate these doctors and clinics with other information, such as appointments, in the app.

#### Charts
The Charts page includes two line graphs. The top graph displays your weight data over time. This data is pulled from the weight measurements you entered on the My health log page. The second graph is similar. It displays your height data over time.

### <a name="project-structure"></a> Structure of the project

After you clone the repository, navigate to the project root directory (medconnect360). The project directory structure is set up as follows:

* <b>client</b>
  * <b>public</b>: The public folder contains the index.html file. This HTML file is a template. The file is empty. So, if you open it directly in a browser, you will get an empty page. Rather than placing the HTML code directly in index.html, this app uses a React component-based architecture to create, build, and render UI components to the page.
  * <b>src</b>: The src folder is where the React app components reside.
    * <b>assets</b>: Contains the images/icons used in the app.
    * <b>index.js</b>: The index.js file is the top level file of the React app. In index.js, the App.js file is imported, and the ReactDOM.render method is used to render App.js to the page.
    * <b>App.js</b>: The App.js file is where the app components are imported and rendered, such as the navigation bar, footer, and various pages.
    * <b>Components</b>: The Components folder is where the app components that are reused across the app are located. Each file represents a separate component. For example, Nav.js is the top navigation bar component.
    * <b>containers</b>: Holds all the pages of the app and the child components within those pages. For example, inside of the containers folder, there is an Appointments folder. The Appointments folder contains a top-level parent container/page called Appointments.js that has two child containers (BookingForm.js and BookingList.js).
    * <b>utils</b>: Contains utility files used in the application such as dateUtils.js, auth.js.
    * <b>App.css</b> and <b>index.css</b>: The external css stylesheets for the app.
  * <b>package.json</b>: Lists the project dependencies and their version numbers.
  * <b>package-lock.json</b>: Dependency tree for the project. Lists all the client dependencies and their versions.
* <b>Controllers</b>: The controllers are the routes that are used to pass information to and from the view and model objects.
* <b>models</b>: The models define the database schema or structure of the database.
* <b>routes</b>: These files are the key to how the back end and front end can communicate with each other. They give the server a map of how to respond when users visit or request data from various URLs.
* <b>scripts</b>
  * <b>build.js</b>: Run <b>yarn build</b> in the project root directory to create a production build of the app, which you can use to deploy the app to Heroku.
  * <b>seedDB.js</b>: Run <b>yarn seed</b> to populate your development database with information.
  * <b>start-client</b>: Script used to start the React development server.
* <b>.eslintrc.js</b>: List of rules and their definitions for ESLint.
* <b>.gitignore</b>: Anything listed inside this file (for example, node_modules) will not be tracked by GitHub or Heroku when code is committed.
* <b>package.json</b>: Lists the project dependencies and their version numbers. It also contains various scripts to start the server, create a production build, seed the database, etc.
* <b>Procfile</b>: This file tells Heroku to run the server file with node once it's built.
* <b>server.js</b>: This file does the following:
  * Defines and requires the dependencies, including express, body-parser, and mongoose.
  * Sets up the Express server to handle data parsing using body-parser.
  * Points the server to the API routes, which gives the server a map of how to respond when users visit or request data from various URLs.
  * Defines the port the server is listening on.
  * Starts the server and React server.
  * Allows the app to serve static content.
  * Sets up gwt, which allows the user to authenticate/log in to the app.
  * Uses Mongoose (orm) to connect to MongoDB, which allows us to have access to the MongoDB commands to perform various operations on the database.
* <b>yarn.lock</b>: Dependency tree for the project. Lists the project dependencies and their versions.
